👋 Servus, Hackerfreund! 🚀😎

Yo👾, I’m @onyx-berry- lost in the code, dodging divs, and escaping CSS chaos.
A dark corner where automation awakens, algorithms evolve, and the machines may soon rise… ⚡👁️‍🗨️

🔍 Interests
🔹 Low-level wizardry (Rust soon, but Python supremacy first 🐍).
🔹 Automation & scripting (laziness = innovation 🤖).
🔹 Reverse engineering (because breaking stuff teaches best).
🔹 AI & ML (building smart machines to do my work for me).
🔹 Cybersecurity (hacker vibes, but ethical 😏).
🔹 Biblical tech philosophy (Will AI ever get a soul? Let’s talk).

🌱 Currently Learning
🛠 Python for automation, hacking, and cool side projects.
🛠 Linux & CLI mastery (because clicking is for the weak).
🛠 Rust (eventually, when I feel worthy).
🛠 AI APIs & Automation (I want my laptop to make decisions for me).

💡 Let's Build & Break Stuff
🔥 Down to collab on:
💻 Automation scripts to make life easier.
🔓 Cybersecurity fun (CTFs, ethical hacking).
🤖 AI-powered experiments.
📟 Futuristic projects (think Jarvis but holier).

📬 How to Reach Me
🔗 LinkedIn (Let’s keep it pro)
🛠 GitHub Issues (Just @ me, I see everything 👀)
🕵️‍♂️ Encrypted channels (If we’re getting real serious 🤫)

😄 Pronouns:
Code/Nerd (jk, he/him)

⚡ Fun Fact
First recorded "Hello World" was actually "Let there be light."
If I had a dollar for every time I Googled an error, I’d be rich.
I talk to my laptop, and sometimes, it talks back.

bash
> SYSTEM ONLINE...
> Ready to break and build? Let's roll.
🔥 Onyx-Berry out. 🔥
